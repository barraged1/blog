# PMV Stash Editorial Guidelines
The PMV Stash Editorial Guidelines are meant to help PMV Stash contributors maintain a high level of data accuracy and aesthetic quality.

Discussion and decisions about the guidelines take place in the [PMV Stash discord](https://discord.gg/GQbeYVBYQ4), in the `#ministry-of-truth` channel.

## Rules

1. Adults Only!

    Do not share any data, metadata, or other info if you suspect it might involve under-age individuals.

1. Consensual footage only!

    Do not submit anything where you have cause to suspect the data is related to original footage that has been published without the consent of the depicted individuals.

1. Be excellent to each other!

## Core Principles

1. Use good judgement in all situations.

    This is the number 1 principle. The entire PMV scene exists thanks to the work of passionate volunteers. PMV Stash can only be successful thanks to the joint efforts of its members.

2. Aim for comprehensive and accurate data that looks good.

    PMVs are essentially an underground and amateur art-form. Consequently, accurate information tends to decay and disappear (e.g. dead links, unknown original release dates) and presentation can be inconsistent and haphazard. We want PMV Stash to counter this entropy by preserving metadata and promoting the more aesthetically appealing elements of the relevant material.

## Scenes

Guidelines for Scene submissions.

### Title
* Prefer using the title that appears in the video itself.
* If no title appears in the video, use the title used by the original artist in their release post.
* There are many edge cases for titles, so if these guidelines don't fit, use your own judgement or discuss it with other users.
### Release Date
* Prefer the earliest release date that is known.
* If only an approximate release date is known, add it. For example "2022-02".
* Add a link to the release post if possible or generally your source for the release date.
* If the source for the release date cannot be linked, simply explain what the source is in your edit comment.
* If release date is unknown, use "1970" or "1970-01-01"
### Cover image
* Prefer the cover image used by the original artist if available.
* If no original cover image is provided, use a still from the video where the title is featured.
* If none of the above apply, use something that looks good.
### Links
* Add all relevant links such as "tube site" uploads, reddit release posts, milovana.com release threads, and torrent tracker uploads.
* Linking to private tracker posts is allowed.

{{< box warning >}}
While we are not aware of any private trackers explicitly prohibiting their users from sharing links to the tracker from elsewhere on the Internet, this might be frowned upon by tracker owners. PMV Stash users who wish to publish links to private torrent trackers should take care to not associate their PMV Stash identity with any of their private tracker identities. PMV Stash itself allows capturing private torrent tracker links.

* Linking to public torrents is allowed through btdig.com.

{{< box info >}}
Public torrents sometimes include more than one PMV. You may link the appropriate torrent to all applicable PMVs (Scenes). You should make an effort to check if the torrent is actually relevant, but neither PMV Stash users nor administrators are required to seed any torrents. The purpose is to capture and organize information about what exists, not to facilitate file sharing.

* Do *not* add direct links to file sharing sites to Scenes.
Site types with favicons are automatically detected for the links you submit. If a site type is missing and you feel it should be added, please contact the PMV Stash admins.

### Tagging
* Tags are meant to help users search effectively. We favor precise tagging with strict tag definitions over bulk or automatic assignment of tags retrieved by scrapers.
* When deciding if a tag applies to video, a good rule-of-thumb is the 20% rule. Does at least 20% of the video relate to this tag? If so, tag it. Note, for more extreme tags it may be helpful to include them even if they are a minor part of the video to help users filter out content they do not want to see.
* Use the Porn Music Video tag for all Scenes that don't fit a more precise genre such as Cock Hero, Hypno Video, or Compilation.
Performers
Add performers where known.
If a performer doesn't exist in PMV Stash, create them.

### Performers
* The purpose of tagging performers into a video is to improve overall video metadata and improve search usefulness for the user.
* Currently, Performers are tagged based on their de facto apperance in the video, not based on a screentime threshold. If an person can be identified, then it would be appropiate to add them as a performer for that video/scene.
* Fictional characters can be considered performers, falling under the same guidelines as above.

### Tag-specific Guidelines

#### Porn Music Video (PMV) vs Hentai Music Video (HMV) Tag
* Videos that contain a majority of content that would be tagged under Animated (2D or 3D) or Art are considered HMVs, no matter if the origin of the content is from an actual japanese hentai animation.

#### Hentai Tag
* This tag refers to the inclusion of specifically japanese hentai animations in a PMV/HMV and will almost always be paired with the "2D Animiated" tag. This does not refer to any japanese fanmade content, but studio-produced adult animation from japan.

#### Visual Effects Tag
* This tag refers to a video that has been edited to include extra visual effects such as flashing lights, zooming, screen pump, abberations, and many others.

## Performers

Guidelines for Performer submissions.

### Fictional Performers

* TBA
